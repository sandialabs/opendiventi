This directory contains a few examples of querying scripts and a general purpose diventi querier.

HTTP Queries:
	Users can send requests via HTTP using the following format

	http://diventiIP:port/query?
		arguments:
			ip (required): the ip addr to query on
			range: the last ip to query for in a range from ip to range
			startTime: the first time in a range of timestamps to query on
			endTime: the last time in a range of timestamps to query on
			type: the format for the data to be returned in

	example:
		http://0.0.0.0:41311/query?ip=0.0.0.0&range=255.255.255.255&type=bin

		this queries a server on the local machine for all ips and returns the data in binary format

	port is currently 41311 for all diventi Servers 

QueryClient.py:
	This script is used for general purpose point and range queries to the Diventi server.

	USAGE:
		minimum needed:
		./QueryClient.py diventiIP(unless defined elsewhere) queryIP

		OPTIONS:
			-r RANGE 	the range of IPs between queryIP and range (inclusive) are queried upon
			-s START 	Defines the first timestamp, all timestamps between start and end (inclusive) are queried upon
			-e END 		Defines the last timestamp, all timestamps between start and end (inclusive) are queried upon
			-f FORM		Defines the format of the returned data
			-p 			Return performance data about the query


	Format Options:
		none (the default): returns ascii
		json: returns a json string
		bin: returns binary data
		verbose: returns ascii with expanded fields (human readable time for example)

	Examples with diventiIP: 0.0.0.0:
		Query a specific ip address: 225.100.90.10
			./QueryClient 0.0.0.0 255.100.90.10

		Query a range of ips starting at 10.50.90.100 and ending with 100.0.0.0
			./QueryClient 0.0.0.0 10.50.90.100 -r 100.0.0.0

		Query for all records of ip 10.0.0.0 after timestamp 123456789
			./QueryClient 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.0 -s 123456789

		Query for all records of ip 10.0.0.0 before timestamp 987654321
			./QueryClient 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.0 -e 987654321

		Query for all records of ip 10.0.0.0 after timestamp 123456789 and before timestamp 987654321
			./QueryClient 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.0 -s 123456789 -e 987654321

		Return json data
			./QueryClient (insert any from above) -f json
			replace json with bin or verbose for other formats

		Note:
			If diventiIP is defined by one of the other sources defined below it can be safely dropped


	Defining Diventi Server:
		script looks in
			/etc/diventi.conf
			.diventi.conf
			cli options

		each level down overrides those above it
		This is done to make defining the server ip less of a hassle

secOrdConn.py
	example of a script which finds all the first and second order connections of a certain ip address

	    1st   2nd
	   /     /
	ip -- 1st -- 2nd
	  \    \
	   \    2nd
	   1st -- 2nd
	     \ 
	      2nd

binary_ex.py
	example of getting and parsing binary data from the server

bin_functions.py
	functions used by binary_ex

close_last_week.py
	example of querying server using for all records on a given ip which occurred within the last week

json_ex.py
	example of getting and parsing json data from the server

query_subnet.py
	example of a range query script
